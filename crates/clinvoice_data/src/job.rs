/// # Summary
///
/// A [`Job`] contains all of the information which pertains to the specific
/// reasons that a [`Client`] has contacted the user's
/// [`Employer`](super::employer::Employer) / the user.
///
/// It also defines the scope of the problem which is to be solved before an
/// [`Invoice`][invoice] is issued.
///
/// # Remarks
///
/// The [`Job`] can be thought of similarly to a support ticket. Whereas other
/// structures may define [the method of payment][invoice], [`Client`]
/// information, and [work periods](Timesheet)â€” this structure defines what
/// work _may_ performed.
