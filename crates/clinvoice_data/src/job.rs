/// A [`Job`] contains all of the information which pertains to the specific

/// [employer](Organization) / the user.
///
/// It also defines the scope of the problem which is to be solved before an
/// [`Invoice`] is issued.
///
/// # Remarks
///
/// The [`Job`] can be thought of similarly to a support ticket. Whereas other
/// structures may define [the method of payment](Invoice),
/// [client](Organization) information, and [work periods](Timesheet)â€” this
/// structure defines what work _may_ performed.
